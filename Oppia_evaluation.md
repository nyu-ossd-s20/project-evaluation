database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
	The code is well documented and details what each function/class does in the program.

are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
