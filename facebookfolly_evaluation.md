## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
Probably, it would depend on how much time I can afford to use to learn C++ and how this tool works with Facebook. If I am able to understand what is happening with the files and what I could do to improve the project, then yes.
1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
I would be not be that interested in contributing to this project, as I do not use Facebook, and since this tool is specific to Facebook, it would not be of any use to me.
