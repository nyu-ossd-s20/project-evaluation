## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?
	JavaScript

1. What is the development environment? <br>
	You can install calypso on any machine or use a virtual machine. The Calypso virtual machine environment is
	called *Calypso Bootstrap* and to use this, you need to have vagrant and virtualbox preinstalled on your device.

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
	Yes, there is an [installation](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/install.md) guide
	in the docs folder of the repository. The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
	To run the project, you need to have git, node, and npm installed. The instructions have links on how to
	properly install these softwares.

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
	Yes. Although I have experience with JavaScript, any beginner can pick up on the source code considering
	how well documented it is.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
	Yes, it has 423K lines of code!

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
	The repository has a folder dedicated to tests and detailed documentation on how to use them. Although there
	are instructions on unit testing, it's not required for contributors to write them.

## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>
	Yes. From the files I've seen, there is a detailed description on the purpose of the file.

1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>
	Not necessarily design but on how to write up code. The [Coding Style Guidelines](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/coding-guidelines.md) provides thorough documentation on how to write/format code in all relevant programming languages.

## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	This is a well organized project that has all the documentation any new contributor needs. The source code files are well documented and the readme file had words of encouragement for new contributors and ways they could get involved. This is definitely a doable project with a great supportive community.
	<!--
	Explain your position. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	I would definitely be interested in contributing to this project. I'm familiar with JavaScript, which is what makes up the bulk of this project. Even if I get lost on what some of the functions mean, the documentation is enough to guide me through the code. Moreover, I enjoyed how welcoming the community is and as a beginner, this would be a good place to start.
