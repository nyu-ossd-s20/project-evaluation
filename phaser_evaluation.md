## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
  I think it is possible to contribute to the project, as I have used other game engines before
  such as Unity and Unreal engine. So I may be able to take my experiences from there and apply
  it to my contributions for this project.

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
  I would probably be interested in contributing to this particular project as I myself am slightly interested
  in game design, and Phaser is a different shift from what I normally work with which is Unity.
