## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?

	Javascript

1. What is the development environment? <br>
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->

	This is a script you would include in your web application, so you just need text editor 

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>

	In order to contribute code, you need to run Video.js locally (they have CDN scripts). In order to do so you need to use node to install the dependencies and build video.js. If you don't have node installed, they provide a link to install node. The instructions are really easy to follow and are step by step. 

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

	If you want to install via npm, you have to install npm (they provide a link to the installation) 

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

	Yes, code seems pretty structured and variables have appropriate names 

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

	Yes, 146k lines of code

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

	There are tests, but it doesn't seem like you are expected to write new tests. 


## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>

	Yes, there are a lot of comments on almost every line/chunk of code

1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>

	Yes, it is located in a separate [repo](https://github.com/videojs/standard)

## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	<!--
	Explain your position. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->

	Yes, because it doesn't seem like that large of a community where it will be that hard to make a contribution. Usually issues and pull requests are handled very quickly and they even include a bunch of other repositories related to video.js that also need contributions. However, it seems like the contributions are mostly going to be centered around code. 

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	<!--
	Explain why you would or would not be interested in contributing to this project. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->

	I would be interested in contributing to this project because it is centered around Javascript (right now I think I want to work on a project with Javascript as the main coding language). Additionally, when you issue a pull request the people seem nice about handling it and even thank you after doing so. My only reservation is that it seems like the contributions are mostly centered around coding-base and I am worried about reading through all of that code if I were to contribute.
