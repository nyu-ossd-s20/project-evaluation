## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project? 
This project is primarily built in JavaScript.

1. What is the development environment? <br>
To install the development environment, you need to use nvm & yarn (package managers), regardless of what machine you're on.

	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
  They have a “Getting Started” section in the readme that tells you how to build the project on your local machine. It’s relatively easy to find and follow. 

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
  The project does require external node modules but there are instructions on how to install them via yarn. 

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
  Most of the code is node.js so if you have knowledge of it, it’s easy to understand. However, if you don’t, there’s no code documentation (no comments) to help you out. 

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
  The project is not on OpenHub so based on the Github Repo itself and the number of contributors there are (7), the project is not huge.

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
  The repository does not have tests and contributors are not expected to write tests.

## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>
  Yes, their code is well documented and has explanations to what they did and why they designed the code in such a manner. 


1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>
  Using the GitHub tags, they have labeled their code base into 4 major categories: Frontend, server, CLI, and Core. On their page they also have a visual representation of their application architecture. The image is not beginner friendly, however, it seems insightful if you understand the backend technology stack.
