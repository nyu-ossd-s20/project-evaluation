        <!--
        Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
        Take the five closed pull requests  (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first created.
        Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.

No, they don't have a CODE OF CONDUCT document.

## Development Environment Installation

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:
    First, developers need to have docker installed. Next, developers need configure the docker as mentioned [here](https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/blob/development/USAGE.md). Finally, developers need to clone the GitHub repository and run the commands listed [here](https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED/blob/development/USAGE.md). However, instructions are not clear and ambiguous.

1. how involved was the process? <br>
We couldn't meaningfully install the development environment because it requires a meter with an ip address on the same network as the host in order to test it. 

1. how long it take you? <br>
Cloning didn't take very long. Our install user already had docker, docker-compose, and npm installed.

1. did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br>
No

1. were you able to build the code following the instructions? <br>
No, see above.

1. did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>
No

1. any other comments? <br>
No




## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
Probably not, as it is very dependent on you owning actual hardware (an energy meter) to use at all, or to test any changes made to the code.
        

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
No, I don't have electricity, No, Not really, not necessarily, No
