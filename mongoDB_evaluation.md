## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?
	C++

1. What is the development environment? <br>
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->
	Available on Linux, Mac, or Windows.

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
	In order to download, build, and install mongoDB you need to create an account and then choose a plan. Follow its relatively simple instructions and it'll build everything for you.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
	No it does not

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
	I'm not too experienced with C++, but I think I understand some of it. A lot of it is dependant on different components, so its hard to determine what each line is supposed to do.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
	Massive project (1.99 Million lines of code)

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
	Yes it has tests, and according to the contributing documentation: "Note that almost all changes require tests to ensure that the code works as expected"


## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>
	Yes, there is clear documentation. They have a whole wiki about it.

1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>
	I could not find documentation on its design.

	7 hours ago

1. How many issues are currently open? <br>
	MongoDB uses a JIRA issue tracker and has 10637 issues

1. How long do issues stay open? <br>
	Of the five closed issues time frames varied (creation to resolve) 3 months to 5 hours. On average the issues stayed open for 3 weeks.
	<!--
	Take the five closed issues (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first reported.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>
	Very active discussion, almost every issue has discussion about the issue.

1. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>
	Issues are not tagged for difficulty

	8504 issues were closed this past six months

1. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project? <br>
	403 contributors

1. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months? <br>
	305

1. How many open pull requests are there? <br>
	42 open pull requests

1. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? <br>
	<!--
	Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
	Take the five closed pull requests  (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first created.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->
	From what it looks like from the last five closed pull requets, the average was just over a week from a request was created to when it was resolved.

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>
	Some definitely has more discussion than others, but when there is discussion, it usually is requesting the signage of contributor agreement.

1. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months? <br>
	22

1. When was the last  pull request  merged? <br>
	8 days ago

## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	<!--
	Explain your position. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
	So there are many issues that can be found on JIRA that show what needs to work on. As Professor Klukowska said in class, it may be hard to find an issue that one can contribute to simply because there's so many people contributing to MongoDB.

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	<!--
	Explain why you would or would not be interested in contributing to this project. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
	It's definitely an interesting project, so I would like to contribute to it. However, as stated above, it'll be difficult to contribute to.
