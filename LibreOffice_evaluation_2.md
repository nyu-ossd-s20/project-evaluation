## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	<!--
	Explain your position. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
  This is very large project and seems very intimidating in terms of contribution. I think although the code languages is familiar to me, it would take me a while to figure out what I would want to contribute and how to even contribute. I would have to learn how most of the software is pieced together and then finally start thinking of feature addition and then FINALLY implement that feature, which I would think would take much longer than the end of the semester.

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	<!--
	Explain why you would or would not be interested in contributing to this project. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
Not really interested in the project. Although it sounds like a cool and useful project, I want to work on a project that I actually use (or would use).
