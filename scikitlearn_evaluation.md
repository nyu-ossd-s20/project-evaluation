## Project Data

1. Project description: <br>
	Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.[3] It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

## License

1. What is the project's license? <br>
	New BSD License  (BSD 3-clause)


## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?
	Python

1. What is the development environment? <br>
	Local Python

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
	Yes and yes. There is an entire instruction site on their website (https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html) which explains it all.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
	Yes: Python, NumPy, SciPy, joblib. There are no instructions on how to install them, but they can all be done with simple pip.
	
1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
	Yes and no - many of the main files are understandable, but the more intense classification algorithms contain relatively complex math.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
	Yes. 160k lines.

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
	Yes there are tests, and no new contributors are not expected to write more as long as your changes pass all existing tests.


## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>
	Yes.

1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>
	Yes, it is very broad (explains how many of the classification algos work).


## Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week? <br>
	33

1. When was the most recent commit? <br>
	Today (March 6th)

1. How many issues are currently open? <br>
	1,443

1. How long do issues stay open? <br>
	2 days

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>
	Yes. Almost every issue has multiple responses.

1. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>
	Yes. There are "Easy" and "Hard" tags.

1. How many issues were closed in the past six months? <br>
	400 issues.

1. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project? <br>
	Yes. There is an "About Us" page on their site (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html).

1. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months? <br>
	300

1. How many open pull requests are there? <br>
	714

1. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? <br>
	No. There is a very quick turnaround time (about a week total).

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>
	Yes. Lots of active discussion.

1. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months? <br>
	600

1. When was the last  pull request  merged? <br>
	2 days ago

## Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>
	Yes. It is in-depth and on their website.

1. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violate it? <br>
	Yes, but there are not consequences.

1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations. <br>
	Yes, constructive but most of the time very succint.

1. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat? <br>
	Neutral.

1. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? <br>
	Not that I could find

## Development Environment Installation

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

1. how involved was the process? <br>
	I work with scikit a lot so had all of the dependencies already, so it was not involved. Without all of the dependencies it might be involved for a new user.

1. how long it take you? <br>
	10 mins

1. did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br>
	New users will need new packages

1. were you able to build the code following the instructions? <br>
	Yes

1. did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>
	No

1. any other comments? <br>
	Obviously a super well-known and well organized project.



## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	Yes. Joanna had mentioned a few negative experiences from last students working on the project, but I still find it both well organized and quick moving.

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	Yes. I use specifically support vector machines a lot, and have used sci-kit for countless projects.
