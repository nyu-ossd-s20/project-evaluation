1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

  Since OpenEMR is a record mananagment system primarily wriiten in PHP it depends on software in the LAMP stack such as Alpine Linux, MySQL or Maria DB, etc.

a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

  The code is a bit difficult to understand with my limited knowledge of PHP.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

## Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>

  The CONTRIBUTING document can be found within the main repository. The document is easy to read and fairly straightforward but the information that is provided seems to be more appropriate for an INSTALL document as there don't seem to be any guidelines on how to go about making a contribution or if there is a preferred format for coding. This information seems to be buried deep within their wiki.

1. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violate it? <br>

  The CODE OF CONDUCT document can be found within the main repository of the project. The document not only lists unacceptable behaviours and consequences, but also provides guidelines on how to make a report if someone breaks the code of conduct as well as guidelines on how to appeal a punishment if one feels that they have been unfairly judged.

1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations. <br>

  Yes. The maintainers do respond in a timely and constructive manner to questions raised in the issues.

1. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat? <br>

  Yes, everyone seems to interact in a respectful manner.
