## Project Data

1. Project description: <br>
	Tidepool aggregates diabetes data. For people who have diabetes and clinicians you can see data from insulin pumps and glucose monitors. It is an easy way to understand what methods are working and what methods are not working. 

1. Project website/homepage: [Website](https://www.tidepool.org/)

1. Project repository: [Repository](https://github.com/tidepool-org)



## License

1. What is the project's license? <br>
BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" License because the tool contains a lot of sensitive private data that needs to be protected. 



## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?
	JavaScript, Go, Swift, Python, Shell


1. What is the development environment? <br>
	Go and using mongoDB.
	

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
	Overall yes the instructions are pretty clear. If you go on the [README of the platform respository](https://github.com/tidepool-org/platform#setup) you can see step by step how to setup and execute. 
	

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
	Depends on mongoDB. If using brew make sure to do mongodb-community, since mongo was recently closed source. Also preferred if you use sublime text. Also need ‘dep’ via brew.


1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
	While it is a large code base, they have provided some tools that make it easier to go through the code. For example they have code navigation where you can click on different functions and it defines the function and also tells you where that function is also referenced throughout the repository. 

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

	74.9K lines of code.

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
	I don’t think there are any tests you have to create, but they have test cases in of which you must pass



## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>
	There are lots of comments on the code itself. However navigating the git is very challenging because there are so many branches. They do not specify what branch is doing what job.

1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>
	While there is some information on https://developer.tidepool.org/ regarding the different pieces of Tidepool, I think the project lacks documentation regarding the overall architecture of the tool. However in each individual repository there are docs that explain the design of that specific part of Tidepool. For example for Tidepool Uploader there is a guide explaining the architecture, the code style, etc. 


## Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week? <br>
	Given that 

1. When was the most recent commit? <br>
	1 hour ago.

1. How many issues are currently open? <br>
	Since there are multiple repositories within the Tidepool project, it is unclear how many issues are currently open. For the Tidepool Uploaded Repository for example there are 11 issues open.   

1. How long do issues stay open? <br>
	<!--
	Take the five closed issues (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first reported.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>

1. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>

1. How many issues were closed in the past six months? <br>

1. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project? <br>

1. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months? <br>

1. How many open pull requests are there? <br>

1. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? <br>
	<!--
	Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
	Take the five closed pull requests  (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first created.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.

## Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>

1. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
