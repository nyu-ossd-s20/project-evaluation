## Project Data

1. Project description: <br>
<!--
What is the purpose of this project? What does the code do? What type of users
does it have?
-->

Blockly is a library that helps us code by using visual blocks. The library essentially adds an editor that allows us to add puzzle like blocks representing what we want our code to do. For example if want to create a loop, we choose a loop puzzle block and pick the type of loop (while, until, etc) and it also allows us to modify other factors such as variable name, etc. Once we place these blocks in our editor it will create the code according to the language of choice. The purpose of this project is to allow users to implement programming concepts without having to worry about syntax for different languages. Since it is a library, it is used for developers to integrate to their web or mobile app (mostly educational). Some of the users of Blockly include, App Inventor, Microsoft MakeCode, etc.

## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?

The primary programming language in the project is JavaScript (92.9%).

2. What is the development environment? <br>
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->
It is a library that gets used with web and mobile (deprecated) applications, so we just need a text editor. 

3. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>

Yes there are instructions for how to download and use Blockly within another project on their website. They provide images, some code samples and clear instructions that make it easy to follow. 

4. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

I don't think there are external additional software modules.

5. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

Looking at the appengine directory (redirect.html) I think their code is not so hard to understand, there are many comments that explain what that code does which makes it easy to follow, however since it is a large project it might be a little difficult to follow.

6. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

It seems like it is a big project with 144K lines of code.

7. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

This repository has a folder for tests. It is stated that after adding code contributors should run existing unit tests and also consider writing more. The project also allows for contributions to improve test coverage, so people can contribute by writing tests.

## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>

Yes throughout the code there are comments explaining what the code does.

2. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>

I don't think there is a design documentation for this project.

Yes, for some of the closed issues that I read there are conversations about how to best solve the issue, etc.

10. How many open pull requests are there? <br>

27 open pull requests.

11. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? <br>
	<!--
	Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
	Take the five closed pull requests  (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first created.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->
No it takes an average of 1 day to get pull requests to be merged.

12. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>

## Development Environment Installation

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

1. how involved was the process? <br>

Following the steps that were outlined on the website, I had to get the code then create an html document that calls the different scripts all of which were outline clearly on their website.

Not long, around 20 minutes.

3. did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br>

No.

Yes I was although at first I ran into some problems and wouldn't get the blocks to display.

5. did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>

No their documentation was thorough. 

6. any other comments? <br>

The code samples on their website were helpful.



## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	<!--
	Explain your position. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
I don't think its possible to contribute to this project in the course of a few weeks since this is a large project and there are a lot of different parts of the project that needs to be read through and understood. 

2. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	<!--
	Explain why you would or would not be interested in contributing to this project. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
Yes I am interested in contributing to this project seeing as its a project that I myself see using. Even though I haven't personally used it myself, while I was playing around with the project I found it quite useful. In the long run this is definitely a project that I would want to contribute to.
