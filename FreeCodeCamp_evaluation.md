## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project? <br>

	__JavaScript__ 
<br>

2. What is the development environment? <br>

	There are [instructions](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md)
 	to set up freeCodeCamp locally on your own system. They say to fork and clone the respository onto
 	your local machine and to simply install Git and your preferred code editor with ESLint setup.
	Or to develop on Gitpod, a free online development environment.
<br>
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->

3. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>

	Yes, [instructions](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md)
	are here. Very easy to find them, as it is one of the first links on the CONTRIBUTING.md page. Instructions seem 
	pretty straightforward, and clean formatting helps.
<br>

4. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

	You can choose to run a Docker build (recommended) or a Local build to run freeCodeCamp locally. For both the
	Docker build and the Local build, the project needs Node.js installed. For Docker build, you need Docker software 
	as specified in instructions, and for the Local build the project needs MongoDB Community Server installed. 
	There aren't instructions on how to install these modules, though links to them are included, but there are 
	instructions on how to run these modules to properly setup the enviornment.
<br>

5. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

	Well, I have little to no experience in JavaScript so I can't say for sure, but at the very least the source code seems to have 
	clearly named variables and has good readability. There are no comments though. I only sort of understand what the code file I'm looking at is doing, but that's largely my inexperience with JavaScript. If someone who was familiar with JS looked at this, I have a feeling they'd probably get the gist of it pretty easily.
<br>

6. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

	The project has around 36,000 lines of code (as of 3 months ago according to OpenHub). There are 
	currently 4005 contributors (as of 3/4/2020).
<br>

7. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

	FreeCodeCamp require you to indicate if you have tested a modification before making a pull 
	request, saying this is very important for non-documentation related changes. On their 
	["How to work on coding challengs" page](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/how-to-work-on-coding-challenges.md) 
	they have detailed instructions on how to test code/function related changes. 

	There is also a ["DevOps at freeCodeCamp" page](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/devops.md) that 
	talks about and has instructions on building/testing/deploying the codebase.
<br>


## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>

	No.
<br>

2. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>

 	There is design docs for how to contribute to the coding challenges codebase: a Challenge Template 
	exists in the ["How to work on coding challengs" doc](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/how-to-work-on-coding-challenges.md). 
	and there is also a JavaScript style guide linked to in the ["Set up freeCodeCamp locally" doc](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md). 
<br>

## Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week? <br>

	19 commits was made the week of Sunday Feb 23rd - Saturday Feb 29th, and 5 commits have been made 
	the week of Mar 1st so far (as of 1:04pm Mar 4th).
<br>

2. When was the most recent commit? <br>

	Most recent commit was Tuesday Mar 3rd.
<br>

3. How many issues are currently open? <br>

	166 open issues.
<br>

4. How long do issues stay open? <br>

	An average of 1.8 days.
<br>
	<!--
	Take the five closed issues (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first reported.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->

5. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>

	Yes there is. There seems to be same day responses for a lot of them, and are usually promptly resolved or has active discussion 
	for issues that take a bit longer to resolve.
<br>

6. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>

	There is a "first timers welcome" tag.
<br>

7. How many issues were closed in the past six months? <br>

	There is no easy way to find this information. GitHub's analytics only seems to track up to the past 
	month, which according to the stats is 54 closed issues from Feb 4th - Mar 4th. (I'm not hand counting the issue tracker.)
<br>

8. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project? <br>

	On the website About page, there's a picture of the freeCodeCamp Team with a caption that lists 7 names.
<br>

9. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months? <br>

	Can't find it. The insights tab's Contributors section lists 20 contributors to master for the past 6 months. 
	However, the Pulse section under insights says 54 authors over the past month to master and many branches.
<br>

10. How many open pull requests are there? <br>

	84
<br>

11. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? <br>

	Usually same day or within one day.
<br>
	<!--
	Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
	Take the five closed pull requests  (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first created.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->

12. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>

	On pull requests that took longer than same day to close, there is active discussion and feedback on the pull request on how to improve 
	the pull requests. Otherwise, there is a Gitpod tester bot that tests the pull request and if it works they often get approved, if not then not approved. 
<br>

13. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months? <br>

	GitHub stats only shows up to past month. If I were to estimate based off going through the pages in the Pull Requests tab, over 1000 have been opened since September 3rd.
<br>

14. When was the last  pull request  merged? <br>

	Yesterday.
<br>

## Welcomeness and Community

Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>

	Yes, quite clear and thorough.
<br>

violate it? <br>

	CODE OF CONDUCT document links to the code of conducts page on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-of-conduct/). 
	There are consequences for acts that violate it.
<br>

## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	<!--
	Explain your position. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->

	There are many ways to contribute outside of just coding in JavaScript, so yes, I think I would be able to contribute in the timeframe.
<br>

2. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	<!--
	Explain why you would or would not be interested in contributing to this project. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->

	Possibly. I have been thinking about learning full-stack web development from freeCodeCamp's curriculum myself 
	(I've already started the HTML portion), so this project does interest me a lot as I think it is a very meaningful project. 
	Also, since the project is run on JavaScript and other web dev tools such as HTML, CSS, Node, it would be a good opportunity to 
	learn those more while I try contributing.
