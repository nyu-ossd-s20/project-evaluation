## Project Data

	Code for Social Good is a global platform to connect nonprofits and open source developers with technical volunteers.

2. Project website/homepage: [Homepage](https://app.code4socialgood.org/about)

3. Project repository: [Repository](https://github.com/Code4SocialGood/c4sg-web)


## License

1. What is the project's license? <br> 

	They use the MIT license.


## Code Base

1. What is the primary programming language in the project?<br>

	The main language is TypeScript.

2. What is the development environment? <br>

	The project is a website so it should run on any type of system. However, their local environment setup instructions only include instructions for Windows.

3. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
	
	There are instructions for how to set up a local environment [here](https://github.com/Code4SocialGood/c4sg-web/blob/master/docs/setup.md). It was easy to find as it was linked on the README page. Though it does seem easy to follow, it only includes instructions for Windows computers.

4. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
	
	For frontend, a contributor needs Node.js and npm packages. For the database, the contributor needs MySQL Community Edition. For backend, they need Eclipse with the plugin Spring Tool Suite and Buildship. 

5. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
	
	The code doesn't seem that easy to understand. The commenting is sparse and there's not much explanation for how anything works.

6. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
	
	They were not listed on OpenHub, but it doesn't seem like a huge project, nor a small project.

7. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
	
	They do have instructions for testing and a development server for testing patches.


## Code and Design Documentation

1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>

	There is no clear, consistent documentation or commenting within the code. There are comments here and there, but nothing significant.

2. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>
	
	There's no in-depth documentation about the design, but they do mention the application architecture.

## Development Environment Installation

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

1. how involved was the process? <br>

	Since we're on the frontend repository, the process for installing the dev environment is very simple. Also the setup guide is super easy to follow.

2. how long it take you? <br> 
	
	Less than 10 minutes.

3. did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br> 
	
	Node.js was required for its npm package manager.

4. were you able to build the code following the instructions? <br>
	
	Yes.

5. did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>
	
	Nope. The setup guide was comprehensive and included links and instructions fo everything.

6. any other comments? <br>
	
	Some praise for their setup guide document. It's super easy to follow for anyone, beginners included.


## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	<!--
	Explain your position. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
	
	Not really, no. There's no clearly defined way to contribute as there is no CONTRIBUTING document. Also, the project hasn't been active since last year.

2. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	<!--
	Explain why you would or would not be interested in contributing to this project. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
	
	This project would require a frontend skillset, as it is simply a website, which some of us has or are interested in improving, but since the project and community is not too active, there are probably better projects requiring similar technologies and toolsets to contribute to over this.
