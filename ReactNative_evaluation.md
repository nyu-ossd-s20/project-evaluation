## Project Data

1. Project description: <br>

<!--
What is the purpose of this project? What does the code do? What type of users
does it have?
-->
    Purpose of this project is to enable user to code React and Javascript in mobile apps
    with ease. Basically we can develop mobile apps with JS and React (framework). React
    native is cross platformed so after development you can run on different platform such
    as Ios, Andriod, and windows etc...

## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?

    Javascript(48%)
    Java (20%)
    C++ (13%)
    Objective-C (10%)
    etc...

1. What is the development environment? <br>
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->
    Some form of coding environment, I would reccomend VSCode.
    Must have javascript, i.e install node.
    React Native CLI.


1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>

    Yes, they have a whole page on how to install and run react native. They show
    explicit screenshots on what commands to run in terminal and how to execute 
    them. They tell you which client to run for which program. If you click on doc's
    it will show a brief outline, but they have more in detail steps in the 
    "docs/tutorial" pages.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

    In terms of mobile developement, all you need to the latest version of Node.js.
    And since this is for mobile developement, you need to make sure you have a mobile device
    in of which you can run your application on. That also means you should have
    XCode or Android Studio installed.

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

    It is very hard to find where the code is, you have to literally scout the all the files.
    The code is really hit or miss, certain parts have tons of documentation and lots of helpful 
    comments as to what they are trying to get at. Whereras other areas, it is a barren land, 
    with no documentation to be seen. The documention is truly helpful is grasping what the code
    is actually doing.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

    There is 413K lines of code. I'm not sure if this includes comments/documention
    though. Might be less if it does.

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

    Repository does contain tests. However, when contributing code, you must write you own tests. This might be bad,
    because they don't go into specifics on how to write your own unit tests and just say the code must pass the tests.
    I hope I did not interpret this wrong.

## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>

    Certains parts there is a lot of documention telling you what each function does. However
    there are certain snippets where no documentation is written.

1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>

    I had to google this, but all it led me to was the get-started page.
    So I am going to so assume there is so SPECIFIC documentation which
    talks about how react native is designed and how it was built.

## Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week? <br>
    
    Between 30-40 commits have been made.

1. When was the most recent commit? <br>

    15 hours ago, on March 7th, 2020

1. How many issues are currently open? <br>

    A total of 664 issues are open.

1. How long do issues stay open? <br>
	<!--
	Take the five closed issues (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first reported.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->

    On average about 8 days. However given how large the project is, some issues
    may be extremely obscure or your issue post may go unseen. So I would say to
    give it an extra 3-5 days for your issue to be answered.

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>

    Some of the posts have actual users attempting to help isolate the problem.
    However, a lot of the times, its just the reactNative bot posting a script
    command and telling them to paste of the result of it. This is most likely due
    to the sheer size of the project and many issues may go unseen.

1. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>

    Not all issues are tagged. However that being said there are very specific tags
    in regards of what the problem is. For a few of the issues, there are tags that target
    new learners saying its a good first issue and help is wanted. So if you were to look
    at this project and try to contribute, I would try to cherry pick those issues. 

1. How many issues were closed in the past six months? <br>
    
    70 issues were closed in the past six months.

1. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project? <br>

    There is a page that talks about partners, core, and community contributers.
    But no specific page that links to whom is whom. 
    On the contributors page, it highlights who has
    made many contributions.

1. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months? <br>

    Has had over 1000 contributors in the past 6 months.

1. How many open pull requests are there? <br>
    
    85 pull requests.

1. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? <br>
	<!--
	Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
	Take the five closed pull requests  (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first created.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->

    It take around 10-12 days for the average pull request to be merged.
    In terms of time, this may not be a lot for a large project, but for students
    this can be a lot.

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>

    Not a lot of helpful comments. Mostly, bots doing automated tests and a few people saying
    thanks here and there. If you don't pass all the CLI tests, it will tell you
    and mark it as red.

1. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months? <br>

    Over 100 pulls requests were opened within the past six months.

1. When was the last  pull request  merged? <br>
    
    3 days ago. On March 4th.

## Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>

    It is pretty detailed and it walks you through step by step on what you should try 
    to do. There are also links to the actual react native web page which tells you what
    you need to download and install.

1. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violate it? <br>

    Yes there is a code of conduct. You risk getting banned/kicked/blacklisted
    from the project if you break the rules and repeatedly break the rules.

1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations. <br>

    Not really, there are a few comments here and there. But a lot of the 
    post are somewhat barren. Mostly just bots commenting. There are a few pages
    with actual helpful comments, but scarce.

1. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat? <br>

    People generally try to be friendly, however there does not seem to be
    a mainstream form of communication. They have a slack channel, twitter, and
    a whole page in regards to proposals.

1. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? <br>

    Yes they do! They actually say thanks many times at each merge.

    None.



## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	<!--
	Explain your position. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
    I would argue no, and not because its not possible. But because the project itself
    is so large, I would have no idea where to begin. Issues and pull requests are scattered
    in every direction and people pick things up so quick. So as a beginner tryign to cherry pick
    certain issues, they might get taken very quickly and you wouldn't even have the chance to
    really work on something.

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	<!--
	Explain why you would or would not be interested in contributing to this project. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
    I would because recently I have been coding in a lot of JavaScipt, but I honestly don't know
    where I would begin. I think that contributing to this could make a big impact for your resume,
    but also could expand your view on the open source world.
