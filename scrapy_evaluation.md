## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	Yes. The project is easy to install, and the majority of the code seems well-documented and easy to follow. The documentation of the project is also very detailed, which will make it easier to understand the project.

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	I am quite interested in web crawling, which is why I picked Scrapy as the project to evaluate. The project is written in Python, a language I am pretty comfortable with, which is a plus. One barrier will be that in order to contribute to the project, network related knowledge will be essential, however I don't have much understanding about the topic. But overall, I would be interested in contributing to the project.
