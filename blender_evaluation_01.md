## Project Data

1. Project description: <br>
<!--
What is the purpose of this project? What does the code do? What type of users
does it have?
-->
Free and open source 3D creation suite.


2. Project website/homepage:

https://www.blender.org/

3. Project repository:

https://github.com/blender


## License

1. What is the project's license? <br>
<!--
In most repositories there will be a file named LICENSE or something similar in
the root level of the repository. This is the one to examine. There may be
different licenses on specific files, but the project will have a main license.
-->
GNU Public License, Version 3


## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?

C

2. What is the development environment? <br>
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->
They have dev enviroments for mac and windows, they recommend using Xcode or or VScode. The IDE needs to support CMake.

3. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>

They have extensive instructions on how to do each of these. The instructions are very step by step and give CL commands for you to copy and paste into your commandline.

4. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

It is dependent upon having CMake on your machine. The external libraries are included in the downloading of blender itself (as per the download instructions).

5. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

The codebase is very extensive and takes a good amount of knowledge of image rending to understand. There are files with hundreds of MACRO's being used so I think it would take a beginner like me a solid amount of time to get a grasp on it.

6. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

The project is massive, based off of openhub, there are 2.13M lines of code.


7. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

The project does have a tests repository, however, the development page does not specify whether or not contributors are expected to write tests for the code they have written. They ask that you speak with an already established contributor when developing for the first time.



## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>

Documentation is not very clear, things are outlined, but code is not explained.

2. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>

Somewhat, they point to very specific things, but general design tactics are added at the top of most of the files that I looked at.


## Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week? <br>

167 to master, 317 to all branches 

2. When was the most recent commit? <br>

4 hours ago to master. (1:30pm 3/3/20 ET)

3. How many issues are currently open? <br>

I do not see any issues on their github. Issues are reported at https://developer.blender.org/. 

4. How long do issues stay open? <br>
	<!--
	Take the five closed issues (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first reported.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->
Anywhere ranging from a couple hours to a week depending on size of issue. Most I found were solved same day, but a couple took a week.

5. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>

Yes, they have a whole forum dedicated to resolving the issues where contributors can comment on posts.

6. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>

No, they are not tagged in such a fashion, but there are "User projects" where people have identified if they are beginners.

7. How many issues were closed in the past six months? <br>

The developer forum does not have an analytics page for this statistic, but off the sheer number of issues and resolutions I bet it is very high.

8. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project? <br>

The forum is extremly indepth where they have tabs for design forums and bug forums alike, in total they have 25 forums.

9. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months? <br>

10. How many open pull requests are there? <br>

0, they use the developers forum.

11. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? <br>
	<!--
	Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
	Take the five closed pull requests  (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first created.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->
	I cannot tell, but the issues are resolved very quickly

12. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>

Since they use a developers forum it is very open to all conversation and debate on the bugs.

13. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months? <br>

I cannot find this because their pull request tab is empty, I know that 64 people have pushed to master in the past month thus assuming that they must have had to merge them.

14. When was the last  pull request  merged? <br>

I know that 64 people have pushed to master in the past month thus assuming that they must have had to merge them.


## Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>



2. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violate it? <br>

3. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations. <br>

4. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat? <br>

5. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? <br>
