## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project? <br>
	C++

1. What is the development environment? <br>
	Anything that can run and compile C++ and Scons files.
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
	Yes, they have a docs page setup that shows how to compile for each platform. Everything is detailed step by step and easy to find.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
	Yes, they have instructions for installations on the same page as the setup guide.	

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
	Code is neatly written but barely any comments to explain the code so it's hard to understand what's going on unless you are somewhat knowledgable about the project.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
	From OpenHub, it says there are 1.2 million lines of code.

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
	Yes, there are tests but contributors are not expected to write any.	



## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>
	Barely any documentation. Maybe small descriptions for a line here and there but no overall explanation of the code.

1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>
	Yes, they have a whole section in the docs page about design.

## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	As of now, probably not. Only because I have no knowledge of the code base so far but I am interested in this project and wouldn't mind attempting to learn it. If not, then I can always stick to documentation contributions in this project.
	<!--
	Explain your position. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	Yes, as stated before I would probably stick with documentation instead of actual code unless there is some elementary issues that don't require extensive knowledge of the code base.
	<!--
	Explain why you would or would not be interested in contributing to this project. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
