## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	<!--
	Explain your position. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
	I talked to the OBS Studio community on discord and from what I was told, OBS is a pretty complex project to jump on board without any spending some time with the code base. I was told to go through their "good-first-issues" which I did but I couldn't find anything that I would be able to do by the end of the semester.

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	<!--
	Explain why you would or would not be interested in contributing to this project. Do NOT simply say 'yes or 'no'.
	-->
	Although I would love to contribute to OBS Studio, given the time constraints, I don't think it is feasible.
