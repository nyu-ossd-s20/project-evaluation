## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project? <br>

	Primarily Java at 38.4%, but C++ is at 31.3% so it's close.

2. What is the development environment? <br>

	Since libGDX projects are built and managed with the Gradle build tool 
	one can develop in "almost any environment." The project namedrops the 3 major Java IDEs: Intellij IDEA/Android Studio, Eclipse, and Netbeans, but highly recommends the Intellij IDE.
	<!--
	For example, is it Gnu C++ on Linux?
	Is it a Windows 10 application? Does one need to develop in a virtual machine?
	-->

3. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>

	There are instructions linked right on the README! The instructions seem pretty easy to follow.

4. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>

	No, everything seems to be packaged into libGDX.

5. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>

	The source code file I looked at does make use of one of libGDX's own packages to a rather large extent, so to completely understand how the code accomplishes some things you'd have to delve into the code in the packages. However, it's not too difficult to understand (clear function names and variable names help).

6. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>

	The project has around 821,000 lines of code (as of 1 month ago according to OpenHub).

7. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>

	The repository has a tests folder. Contributors are not expected to write tests, but they are expected to detail how they tested their code in their pull requests.




## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>

	No there isn't, but there are Javadocs available online and bundled with libGDX.

2. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>

	Doesn't seem like it. There are guidelines that talk about formatting, code style, compatibility, and performance considerations in the [Contributing](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/documentation/hacking/Contributing.html) document.

## Activity Level


1. How many commits have been made in the past week? <br>

	10 commits in the past week

2. When was the most recent commit? <br>

	274 issues are currently open

4. How long do issues stay open? <br>

	Issues stay open for an avg. of 1.8 days.
	
	<!--
	Take the five closed issues (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first reported.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->

5. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>

	Discussion is decently active. But it depends on the kind of issue. Some open issues don't have any discussion, but some (both open/closed) issues have a decent amount of discussion.

6. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>

	There is a "good first issue" tag, but it seems to be rarely used.

8. Is there information about how many people are maintaining the project? <br>

	There is a CONTRIBUTORS and AUTHORS doc.

9. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months? <br>

	According to GitHub's Insights tab, there have been 13 contributors to master (code contributions) in the past 6 months. However, this does not take into account other types of contributions such as issue reports or wiki contributions.

10. How many open pull requests are there? <br>

	<!--
	Look at the closed pull requests to see how long they stayed open.
	Take the five closed pull requests  (they can be most recently closed or a sample distributed over time) and look at when each was first created.
	Compute the number of days that each was open and take the average.
	-->

12. Read the conversations from some open and some closed pull requests.  Is there active discussion on the pull requests? <br>
