## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
Probably not, as the code is very hard to understand at a glance, and I know absolutely nothing about the Lua programming language.

I would be interested if there was a way to contribute non-coding-wise, otherwise no.
