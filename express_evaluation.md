## Project Data

1. Project description: <br>
As described in their repository, Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for NodeJS. It's purpose is to provide the most necessary tools for web development on NodeJS in a simple and easily accessible manner. The majority of the users are software engineers.

## License

1. What is the project's license? <br>
MIT License



## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project? JavaScript (100%)

1. What is the development environment? <br>
It is a framework for NodeJS, so naturally it requires NodeJS, which is cross-platform.

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
Yes, there are. They are very simple.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
Yes. As mentioned in the first question, Express is a Node module, so NodeJS is required, and there is a link to a guide on how to install Node. Other than that, Express uses a lot of dependencies, but they are imported on build.

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
I think if one has used Express in the past, and knows decent JavaScript, it is not too difficult, but not too easy either.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
16K lines of code. Not that big.

1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
It does. Answering to the latter part of the question, it is not specified and I couldn't find concrete links between newly added code and tests.


## Code and Design Documentation
1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>
In some places there is, but in some there is none. Also, the commentary is quite minimal. There is, however, extensive documentation on how to use the project.

1. Is there documentation about the design?  <br>
Specifically about the design, no.


## Activity Level

117

1. How long do issues stay open? <br>
(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 5 = 1

1. Read the conversations from some open and some closed issues. Is there active discussion on the issues? <br>
Yes, however it seems that the issues page serves as a help forum for the developers that are using Express.

1. Are issues tagged as easy, hard, for beginners, etc.? <br>
No.

1. How many issues were closed in the past six months? <br>
100

Only the lead contributor.

1. How many contributors has the project had in the past six months? <br>
0

73

1. Do pull requests remain un-answered for a long time? <br>
(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 5 = 1

Yes, there is.

1. How many pull requests were opened within the past six months? <br>
50

1. When was the last  pull request  merged? <br>

## Welcomeness and Community

1. Is there a CONTRIBUTING document? If so, how easy to read and understand is it?
Look through it and see if it is clear and thorough. <br>
Yes, there is. It is not a long document and it is easy to read through, although the contribution guidelines are quite obscure and are more focused on the processes from the lead contributors.

1. Is there a CODE OF CONDUCT document? Does it have consequences for acts that
violate it? <br>
No, there is no Code of Conduct.

1. Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
Are responses generally constructive? Read the issue conversations. <br>
Yes, they do respond helpfully and explain the problems if there are some. They also give advice on what to do next.

1. Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat? <br>
It seems like it.

1. Do maintainers thank people for their contributions? <br>
Usually they do, but if it's some dumb contribution, they don't (there are some issues like "Testing" by some random people).


## Development Environment Installation

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

1. how involved was the process? <br>
It wasn't very involved, because I have Node environment installed properly.

1. how long it take you? <br>
5 min.

1. did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br>
NodeJS.

1. were you able to build the code following the instructions? <br>
This is a framework, so I was able to boot it up on my custom project.

1. did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>
No.

1. any other comments? <br>
Nope.




## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
I think it is possible, because they lack, for instance Code of Conduct, so maybe proposing it would work. However, they became quite sucessful and known without it (Express is there since 2009), so I am not really sure. It's a huge project, it is used in 6 million repositories in GitHub, and it is probably the most popular NodeJS framework that exists, so realistically it would be really hard to make a contribution that will be accepted. Plus, in the past few months, the activity was extremely low, and I think pull request acceptance rate is like 2%.

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
I surely would, although, as I expressed above, I'm not sure how realistic it is to do so. But this is the project that I use, and personally it would be amazing to contribute to such a project.
