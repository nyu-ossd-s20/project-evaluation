Summary
-------

1.  Do you think this is a project to which it would be possible to
    contribute in the course of a few weeks before the end of this
    semester?

    Yes. Adding a code of conduct or helping draw one up would be good.  There are also a lot of issues that are tagged as "easy",
	that I'm sure I can try and help with since most of this project is in Python (One of my better languages).

2.  Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project?

    Yes.  I loved playing Pokemon growing up, so contributing to a similar game that's open source would be really cool.  
	Additionally, it uses Python, which is one of my more fluent languages.
