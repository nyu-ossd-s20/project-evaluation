## Development Environment Installation

Install the development environment for the project on your system.
Describe the process that you needed to follow:

1. how involved was the process? <br>
Almost nothing
1. how long it take you? <br>
Just a minute, for node
1. did you need to install additional packages or libraries? <br>
Just Node.js
1. were you able to build the code following the instructions? <br>
Nope! currently working with people in the discord to sort that out
1. did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>
Same as above
1. any other comments? <br>
The project is definitely a little desolate on the actual github page, but were hoping we can breathe some
life back into it.  There are plenty of people willing to give guidance, so we think we can make it work.



## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	Yes! Doesn't look great from the evaluation, but the active discord community is a major plus, and the project itself
	simple enough that we can understand it quickly and get to contributing.
1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	Yes.  Its somewhat stripped down, but its an interesting take on the creation of branching narrative games.
