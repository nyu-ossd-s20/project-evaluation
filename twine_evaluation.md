## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?
  Javascript

1. What is the development environment? <br>
	No special dev environment, just code in anything that can work with javascript, HTML, or CSS.

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
  There are some basic instructions on the repo's README file. They seem pretty easy to follow, as it isn't too complicated to install and build.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
  It uses a couple things, mainly npm for installing and building the app. If you want to build to MacOS or Linux, you need Wine and Makensis.

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
  It seems nicely organized, and there are a smattering of inline comments around.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
  It's not a super big project, and thus I can't find it on OpenHub. RIP


1. Does the repository have tests? If so, are the code contributors expected to write tests for newly added code? <br>
  Yes! It also specifies in their contributing document that contributors should create Jest unit tests.

1. Is there clear documentation in the code itself? <br>
  Depends on the script, but there does seem to be some brief documentation in the code for certain methods and such.

  There is some documentation on the design in their wiki page, but it the site appears to be temporarily down right now.

## Development Environment Installation

  Yep

1. did you need to look for additional help in installing the environment? <br>
  Not really, mainly just installing the external libraries and such were the biggest problem.

## Summary
1. Do you think  this is a project to which it would be possible to contribute
in the course of a few weeks before the end of this semester? <br>
	While I am interested and really like the app itself, I am unsure whether or not it would be a good project to work on as a group. It is not super active, but that also might mean that there is a decent amount of stuff to work on. What contributions do get made do seem to have some good discussion though.

1. Would you be interested in contributing to this particular project? <br>
	I would be interested in contributing mainly because it is written in mostly Javascript, HTML, and CSS, which I am familiar with, and that I enjoy using the program myself. Otherwise, it is still yet to be seen whether or not it is a good idea for a group to try and contribute, if it is active enough.
