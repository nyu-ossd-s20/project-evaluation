## Code Base


1. What is the primary programming language in the project?
  Javascript

1. What is the development environment? <br>
	No special dev environment, just code in anything that can work with javascript, HTML, or CSS.

1. Are there instructions for how to download, build, and install? How easy is it
to find them? Do they seem easy (relatively speaking) to follow? <br>
  There are some basic instructions on the repo's README file. They seem pretty easy to follow, as it isn't too complicated to install and build.

1. Does the project depend on external additional software modules such as
database,  graphics, web development, or other libraries? If so, are there clear instructions on how to install those? <br>
  It uses a couple things, mainly npm for installing and building the app. If you want to build to MacOS or Linux, you need Wine and Makensis.

1. Is the code easy to understand? Browse some source code files and make
a judgment based on your random sample. <br>
  It seems nicely organized, and there are a smattering of inline comments around.

1. Is this a big project? If you can, find out about how many lines of code
are in it, perhaps on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/). <br>
  It's not a super big project, and thus I can't find it on OpenHub. RIP

  Yes! It also specifies in their contributing document that contributors should create Jest unit tests.

  Depends on the script, but there does seem to be some brief documentation in the code for certain methods and such.
